									Everyone seems to know what a mask is, but many are still confused on how and when to wear a mask. There are many different sources that state different things but according to the World Health Organization, this is how to effectively wear a mask. Before donning your mask, it is important that your hands are clean and free of any germs. Sanitize or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you touch the mask. Observe the mask for any holes, tears or rips, and ensure that your mask is safe. Do not wear that same mask more than once unless it is classified as reusable. Next, locate the stiff edge of the mask. This should feel like a metal wire. This is the side that will rest on your nose. Ensure that the coloured or patterned side is facing outwards and carefully put on your mask attempting to avoid tearing or accessible touching. Adjust the mask so that it fits completely over your nose, chin, and mouth and covers roughly half of your face. If the mask fails to cover half of the face, it is too small and a larger mask should be purchased. Avoid accessible touching or moving of the mask while wearing as that spreads bacteria and germs all over your face. Remember to stay safe and wear your mask when social distancing is not possible. Continue to follow your public health guidelines so we can recover from this virus.

									<h3>What Is COVID-19</h3>

									At the beginning of 2020, a global pandemic struck our world and changed everything that people were used to. Understandably, people are scared because it was a new virus that was easily transferred, it also doesn’t help that there are so many opposing scientific articles most which have been misleading. So the true question is what is Covid-19? Well, Covid-19 is classified in the larger family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Other viruses that are in this category vary from the common cold to some other major outbreaks such as The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-Cov) which took place as well as The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov) outbreak which took place in 2003.
								</p>
								<p>
									The most common symptoms are high fevers, Fatigue, and a dry cough. Some people contract the virus but are Asymptomatic which means that they are contagious but show no signs of possible symptoms. The recovery rate without any special assistance is incredibly high at 80% which is really good! 
								</p>
								<p>
									Now people are wondering who is the most at risk of contracting this virus? The main people who have fallen severely ill from this virus are apart of the older generation of above 60 years old. As well as people who have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, and cancer. 

								<p>
									And finally, what do you do when you experience these symptoms go get tested at your local Covid-19 testing location and isolate yourself as best as possible while you wait for your results. Please do not go to your hospital or clinic if you think you have Covid-19 and require aid without calling ahead of time to allow them to give the best location for you to go as many hospitals have a large elderly population that frequent and they would like to keep it as safe as possible for everyone.

									It’s definitely difficult to motivate yourself throughout quarantine and self-isolation, and most people are probably struggling with finding ways to stay organized. There are many ways to help you stay on top of your school work and just keeping your mental health up in general. This includes the few tips seen on the poster. By creating a routine, you will boost your motivation and not feel as stressed. If you are to stray from keeping a routine, procrastination will get the best of you. Keeping communication during this whole pandemic is also important, and probably one of the most important tasks of all. Make sure to communicate with friends, family, teachers, and anyone else who you feel the need to reach out to. You may not be able to see them in person, but that’s what Facetime, texting, and email is for. Just a simple email to whomever to ask them if everything’s alright will make their day!
								</p>
								<p>
									To keep on top of your schoolwork, make sure to keep a tidy workspace and a separate work area. If you have a messy work area, most likely your work will be messy as well! Also, having a clean workspace will really give you a positive mindset when you’re doing your work.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now, I know most teenagers enjoy TikTok, but focusing on the daily tasks that need to be done will create less stress in the future. By procrastinating, you’re only creating more work for yourself in the future. Of course, it is perfectly fine taking a break(as long as you get the task at hand finished beforehand!). Maybe set one or a few 15 minute time slots throughout the day to give yourself a quick break.

									<h3>Coping With Stress During COVID-19</h3>

									A lot is happening right now and instead of becoming overwhelmed and overly stressing yourself even more and allowing yourself to multiply your stress, it is extremely important to handle and control your stress, anxiety and any other powerful emotions you may be experiencing. The best way to deal with your stress and other powerful emotions during these difficult times is to first remember that its 100% normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared, and even angry right now. Talking about your emotions to people in your life who you trust is extremely important and takes the weight off your shoulders. If you don't feel fully comfortable talking about them right away you can write them down in a notebook as a release and then when you become more comfortable talk to someone.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mental health and physical health go hand in hand so make sure that you stay healthy during this time is super important for you. Remember as hard as it might be your body and mind will be so grateful for it so keep a proper diet, get adequate sleep and exercise, and maintain levels of social interaction with your family and friends in person safely of course or online. Don’t turn to certain methods of coping such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and drug use as a way to escape your issues and emotions. All it will do for you is give you an expensive temporary release and leave you feeling worse about your problems/emotions as well as an extremely dangerous addiction. If you feel like you need more help to seek it from a professional.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another major thing is to limit how much time you and your family spend watching and listening to the media coverage of the pandemic. Oftentimes the news only mentions the negative views and that can really take a toll on how you perceive things, so watch every few days instead of every day. Maybe even try to do your own research on some possible benefits of quarantine like the amazing benefits it has on the planet and that you have time to work on yourself, learn a new skill, pick up a hobby etc.
