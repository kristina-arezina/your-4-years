									Everyone seems to know what a mask is, but many are still confused on how and when to wear a mask. There are many different sources that state different things but according to the World Health Organization, this is how to effectively wear a mask. Before donning your mask, it is important that your hands are clean and free of any germs. Sanitize or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you touch the mask. Observe the mask for any holes, tears or rips, and ensure that your mask is safe. Do not wear that same mask more than once unless it is classified as reusable. Next, locate the stiff edge of the mask. This should feel like a metal wire. This is the side that will rest on your nose. Ensure that the coloured or patterned side is facing outwards and carefully put on your mask attempting to avoid tearing or accessible touching. Adjust the mask so that it fits completely over your nose, chin, and mouth and covers roughly half of your face. If the mask fails to cover half of the face, it is too small and a larger mask should be purchased. Avoid accessible touching or moving of the mask while wearing as that spreads bacteria and germs all over your face. Remember to stay safe and wear your mask when social distancing is not possible. Continue to follow your public health guidelines so we can recover from this virus.

									At the beginning of 2020, a global pandemic struck our world and changed everything that people were used to. Understandably, people are scared because it was a new virus that was easily transferred, it also doesnâ€™t help that there are so many opposing scientific articles most which have been misleading. So the true question is what is Covid-19? Well, Covid-19 is classified in the larger family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Other viruses that are in this category vary from the common cold to some other major outbreaks such as The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-Cov) which took place as well as The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov) outbreak which took place in 2003.
								</p>
								<p>
									The most common symptoms are high fevers, Fatigue, and a dry cough. Some people contract the virus but are Asymptomatic which means that they are contagious but show no signs of possible symptoms. The recovery rate without any special assistance is incredibly high at 80% which is really good! 
								</p>
								<p>
									Now people are wondering who is the most at risk of contracting this virus? The main people who have fallen severely ill from this virus are apart of the older generation of above 60 years old. As well as people who have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, and cancer. 
								</p>
								<p>
									And finally, what do you do when you experience these symptoms go get tested at your local Covid-19 testing location and isolate yourself as best as possible while you wait for your results. Please do not go to your hospital or clinic if you think you have Covid-19 and require aid without calling ahead of time to allow them to give the best location for you to go as many hospitals have a large elderly population that frequent and they would like to keep it as safe as possible for everyone.
